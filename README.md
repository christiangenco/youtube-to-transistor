# Youtube to Transistor

This script pulls the audio and description from the most recently published YouTube video on a particular channel and re-uploads it as a podcast episode to [Transistor.fm](https://transistor.fm/).

You'll need to install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/) and run `npm install` or `yarn install` for it to work.

Invoke this script with a command that looks like this:

```
node index.js --channelId="UC5k3OvvdQArN1g4pE8RgJdw" --showId="15816" --transistorApiKey="api-key-goes-here" --youtubeApiKey="api-key-goes-here"
```

Here's where to find each of those arguments:

- `channelId`: your YouTube channel ID, found in the URL of your channel's page on YouTube (ex: `https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5k3OvvdQArN1g4pE8RgJdw`)
- `showId`: your Transistor.fm show ID, found by [listing your shows through the Transistor API](https://developers.transistor.fm/#shows)
- `transistorApiKey`: found at [dashboard.transistor.fm/account](https://dashboard.transistor.fm/account) under `API Access`
- `youtubeApiKey`: generated by following the instructions at [Obtaining authorization credentials](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) on the YouTube Data API site
